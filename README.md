# Keylogger


This project presents the development and implementation of a comprehensive computer 
monitoring system with keylogging as a primary feature. The system tracks and logs various user 
activities, including keyboard inputs, clipboard changes, running and installed applications, Wi-
Fi and Bluetooth status, IP address modifications, and screenshots. The keylogger functionality 
records all keystrokes, providing detailed insights into user behavior. Additionally, clipboard 
monitoring and screenshot capture further enhance the system’s ability to gather contextual data. 
The system stores the logs in designated files and periodically emails them to a specified 
recipient, ensuring remote monitoring.
The project also includes real-time monitoring of network-related information, such as Wi-Fi and 
Bluetooth connectivity, and logs changes in the system’s IP address. It tracks running 
applications, providing a snapshot of the system’s activity, and monitors installed applications 
with daily updates. Through email integration, the system securely transmits all captured data, 
ensuring timely and consistent reporting.
